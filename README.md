sciret
======



The latest version was updated in 2009.
I just want to make it adapted to the newest environment.
You can find the old version by these two urls:
http://freecode.com/projects/sciret
http://sourceforge.jp/projects/sfnet_sciret/

It's a good software, I hope that the software could help more people.
